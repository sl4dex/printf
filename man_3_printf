.RB [ ARGUMENT ] ... 

.SH DESCRIPTION
Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT

.B Format of the format string
       The format string is a character string composed
       of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which
       are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
       specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
       subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
       introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion
       specifier.

       The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier. 
       By default, the arguments are used in the order given, where each 
       conversion specifier asks for the next argument.

FORMAT interpreted sequences are:

.IP
- %%    a single %
.IP
- %c    char format
.IP
- %s    string format
.IP
- %d %i	int format
.IP
- %b    unsigned int to binary format
.IP
- %r    reverse string format
